# AMADA: Arctic Monkeys' Albums Data Analysis

## Intro

**AMADA** is an analysis of the **statistical data**, e.g. listenership size, average music length, most listened songs, etc. and the **lyrical data**, e.g. word count, most common words, lyrics relation to its song's name, etc. contained within the **Arctic Monkeys' discography**.

## File Structure

The project is separated into three main folders: **data**, **scripts** and **results**.

The data folder is where every source of data, be it .csv files and similars or URLs to be scraped, are stored.

The scripts folder is where the Python scripts for reading and extracting useful data from the data sources are kept.

The results folder is where the extracted, meaningful data is stored in formats adequate for human reading.
